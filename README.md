A simple desktop-only (for now) front-end weather web app that is built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, and jQuery. The app prompts the user to input a city, and as they are typing into the search bar, they are provided autocomplete options via the Google places API. The app fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and promptly displays it to the user (along with an icon representing the current weather) with the option to return to the homepage to view another city's current weather.
